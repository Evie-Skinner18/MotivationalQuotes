# Motivational Quotes
A Vue 3 and C#.Net 5 Azure Functions app showing motivational quotes!

# Architecture
Motivational Quotes uses a Vue single page application to display a motivational quote to the user at the click of a button. It does so by consuming an Azure functions API, via an intermediary 'provider' class written in TypeScript.

# In a Future Iteration I Would...
- Implement the factory pattern in a more sophisticated way
- Add a data access layer and store the motivational quotes resources in Azure blob storage or Cosmos DB
- Make the front end app more stylish and attractive
- Add unit tests for the domain logic
- Implement Azure AD authentication for the front end app, using msal.
